## Fauna SDK for iOS

Fauna SDK for iOS + Examples

### Requirements

* git
* Xcode 4.5.2
* iOS 4.3

### API Coverage

The Fauna SDK for iOS is designed for use in distributions of client applications. It provides access to the parts of the Fauna API accessible via [Client Keys](https://fauna.org/API) and [Tokens](https://fauna.org/API):

* [User Signup, Tokens and Passwords](https://fauna.org/API#resources-users)
* [Timelines](https://fauna.org/API#timelines)
* [Instances](https://fauna.org/API#resources-instances)
* [Commands](https://fauna.org/API#access_model-commands)

It does not currently provide access to publisher or administrative features of the API.

### Content

The code is organized in two projects under a single XCode workspace:

* Fauna: Fauna API Client.
* FaunaChat: A simple Example Chat-like application built with the Fauna API Client.

### Running the Example Project

Make sure you have Ruby 1.9 and the `fauna` gem installed. Then:

1. `git clone git@github.com:fauna/fauna-ios.git`
2. `cd fauna-ios`
3. `env FAUNA_TEST_EMAIL=email@example.com FAUNA_TEST_PASSWORD=pass open Examples/FaunaChat/FaunaChat.xcodeproj/`

Finally, click run in Xcode.

### Using Fauna SDK in your Xcode Project

1. `git clone git@github.com:fauna/fauna-ios.git`
2. Close any open Xcode projects related to the Fauna SDK (workspace, Fauna, FaunaChat, etc).
2. Open your Xcode project and using Finder, go to the directory fauna-ios/Fauna and Drag and Drop the file `Fauna.xcodeproj` into your Xcode project, right under the root of your project.
    Your Xcode project structure should now look like this:

    ```
      yourFaunaProject
        -> Fauna.xcodeproj
          -> Fauna
            -> Fauna.h
        -> yourFaunaProject
          -> yourFaunaProjectAppDelegate.h
        -> Frameworks
        -> Products
    ```
    You should see a tree under Fauna.xcodeproj. If you don't see it then it's probably because Fauna.xcodeproj was already open in another Xcode instance. Go back to step 2.

3. Select your Project in the tree, select a Target(mostly with the same name as your project), navigate to the `Build Phases` tab and expand `Target Dependencies`. Click on `+` and Select `Fauna`.

4. You are ready to use Fauna via `#import <Fauna/Fauna.h>`

### Initializing the API Client

The best place to initialize the Fauna API Client is in your AppDelegate, example:

```
Fauna.client = [[FaunaClient alloc] initWithClientKeyString:@"<your-client-key>"];
```

Check `FaunaExampleAppDelegate.m` in the FaunaChat project to see a more detailed snippet.
